Software dependencies:
If working on a Mac operating system, x11 forwarding is required to generate and view python plots. 
Link to tutorial on setting up x11 forwarding, made by Jenny Fothergill - https://youtu.be/bEyhUyolevU
You also need a python program to create your plots- download Anaconda-Navigator or Miniconda.

If working on another operating system on @coen-bascottie, to edit the code, you need a Boise State account, as well as the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client to run the BSU VPN. Or if you're immune to Covid-19, break into an engineering computer lab at Boise State and use a university computer.

Github account and computer terminal required to pull the ssh key and run on your local device.
